## Example - Adds a book

* When you enter the title of a book, the system checks whether it is new or old. If it is new, it is stored as a new book; otherwise, it is restored.

* This process is similar to that of other items as well.

* After successfully adding the item, the system will automatically redirect to the **Add Items** menu again.
